# EventbriteGraphBlockchain
The Graph is a web3 protocol that allows developers to create GraphQL APIs to query data from any smart contract. This makes it fast and easy to create dashboards and websites that show live data about how users are interacting with your contract.

Anyone can deploy their own API, also called a subgraph. Our subgraph will allow us to connect our frontend website(EventbriteDapp) to our contract(EventBriteSoliditySmartcontract) so we can easily fetch the data we need.

Without The Graph, developers had to run their own indexing servers to be able to query their smart contract data. This can be expensive to run, and because itâ€™s a centralized server it could be vulnerable to down-time and censorship.
